This is a plain markdown post. Also serves as an informal changelog for this project:

- First step was installing eleventy via npm and following this minimal [tutorial](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/). At this point I created a minimal `layout.liquid` file, some `.md` files in a `posts` folder, and `index.html` file in the root folder to create the index page, and a `posts.json` file in the posts folder to ensure that everything in the `posts` folder is automatically given a "posts" tag 
- Second step was installing the eleventy [syntax highlighting](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) plugin and adding it to the `.eleventy.js` configuration file in the project root folder. To get it working you also need to modify the template in the `layout.liquid` file so that it loads the PrismJS syntax highlighting JS from your favourite CDN. Once that was complete, code blocks show syntax highlighting but of course they do not execute.
- Third step was to test the basic idea for knitr integration. I created a post with the `.kmd` file extension, in which the R code chunks are written using knitr syntax. Eleventy ignores this file, but I can call `knitr::knit()` to create a knitted markdown file with the `.md` file extension. Eleventy picks up this `.md` file and creates the corresponding `.html` for the blog 
- Fourth step was remembering that I should probably have this in a git repo... so yeah. Added the `_site` folder to `.gitignore` for now. I also wanted a `README.md` file for github that isn't part of the blog, so now I need to add an `.eleventyignore` file (see [here](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ignores/)) too so that eleventy doesn't try to include the readme in the static site
- Fifth step was to add some nice css styling. I could write my own but why? Instead I chose to use [skeleton](https://getskeleton.com) for lightweight css templating. There's a few ways for eleventy to handle [static assets](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/assets/): I took the easiest path and added a passthrough to my `.eleventy.js` file
- Sixth step was to set it up to deploy to github pages. The [output directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#output-directory) needs to go to `docs` rather than `_site`, and we need to ensure that eleventy ignores the `docs` folder. Also need `.nojekyll` and `CNAME` files with a passthrough so it ends up in the `docs` folder, and setup the CNAME resource record for the subdomain [knitr-11ty.djnavarro.net](https://knitr-11ty.djnavarro.net) so that it deploys correctly. In this instance I'm deploying to the root of a subdomain so I don't have to bother with this but if you're [deploying to a subdirectory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#deploy-to-a-subdirectory-with-a-path-prefix) you need to set a path prefix
- Seventh step was to rejig the blog so that each post is a subfolder rather than a single file. The blog I set up from the tutorial uses a single file per post, and eleventy writes `posts/my-blog-post.md` to `_site/posts/my-blog-post/index.html` (or in this case `docs` not `_site`). That's convenient if the whole blog post is just a single markdown file but it won't work in the knitr context because we need the `.kmd` file (knitr markdown), the rendered `.md` file, and any images knitr creates to be grouped together. For the images in particular it's important that we preserve the directory structure or else everything breaks. Fortunately this is easy: you just create the desired folder structure and rename the files to "index". So now I have `posts/my-blog-post/index.md` as the markdown, and eleventy will also write that to `_site/posts/my-blog-post/index.html`.
- Eighth step was to make sure that we have a passthrough rule that ensures that the knitr-generated png files are copied to the output, so we now update the `.eleventy.js` file to create a rule for png files
- Ninth step was to write a simple `render.sh` shell script that calls `knitr::knit()` to render a post from `.kmd` to `.md`. After a little bit of thought I decided that since (a) eleventy is very fast at rebuilding the website and (b) I've had bad experiences with tools that "automatically" decide when to re-render a source document, it makes sense not to automate the knit process for this toy project
- Tenth step was to edit the template to allow (minimal) support of social media tags
- Eleventh step was to add mathjax support
